Subagents for pi: let your main conversation hand work to named, steerable helper agents — in parallel, nested, and resumable.

📜 [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## Install

Requires pi **0.99.2+**. No build step.

```sh
pi install npm:pi-subagent-manager
```

For local development:

```sh
pi install /absolute/path/to/pi-subagent
# Or try it without installing:
pi -e ./src/index.ts
```

## How it works

It combines ideas from two tools:

- **Like Claude Code subagents:** each agent runs in its own session, with its own system prompt, model and tools, and hands back only its final answer. Agent **types** are Markdown files with frontmatter. The type says _what job_ an agent does.
- **Like Codex:** every running agent has a **path**, such as `/root/fix-auth/review`. The path says _where it sits_ in the tree.

Type and path are independent. One `reviewer` type can run at `/root/fix-auth/review` and `/root/docs-pass/review` at the same time.

```text
/root                          ← your main pi conversation
  /root/fix-auth               ← child: starts with a snapshot of /root
    /root/fix-auth/review      ← grandchild: snapshot of /root/fix-auth
/k                             ← independent root: no /root history
```

## What a subagent can do

- **Finish** — returns a final answer (not its whole transcript) to the parent.
- **Pause** — hands back without an answer; resume it later.
- **Report progress** — sends updates while it keeps working.
- **Be steered** — the parent can send it more input, or resume it after it finishes.
- **Survive restarts** — threads are saved with the main session and come back on `/reload` or `pi --resume`.

## Bundled agents

| Type         | Use it for                                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `architect`  | Plans, tradeoffs, coordinating other agents         |
| `coder`      | Implementation, debugging, refactoring, frontend UI |
| `researcher` | Source-backed codebase and web research             |
| `reviewer`   | Finding real defects; suggests minimal fixes        |
| `tasker`     | Small bounded jobs and quick repo lookups           |
| `writer`     | Prose and editing                                   |

They inherit your current model until you set preferences. Details: [docs/default-agents.md](docs/default-agents.md).

## Commands

| Command          | Opens                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/agents`        | Settings (mode, limits, model picking, tool filtering) |
| `/agents types`  | Agent-type browser and editor                          |
| `/agents tree`   | Fullscreen tree and live viewer with manual steering |
| `/agents import` | Import agents from other subagent extensions           |
| `/agents reload` | Reload definitions and settings                        |
| `/agents reap`   | Confirm the eligible count, then forget completed agents and free retained-thread slots (cannot be resumed); preserves active parents and ancestors of retained threads. Session files remain on disk. |

A live **Agents** widget sits above the input box. Choose **Full** (the existing tree) or **Minimal** (colored status counts and running-agent token totals, plus the browser hint) under **Status Widget** in `/agents` settings. In the fullscreen tree, **Enter** opens an agent's live view. Type in the bottom **Steer** input and press **Enter** to send it a steering message, including nested agents. **Tab** switches between input and transcript controls, **Escape** returns, and **i** in the tree opens existing thread actions. A status strip below the previews shows how many agents are running and **Press ← to open subagent browser**. Once the main turn ends and all subagents are idle, the preview collapses to a single status-count line. A fresh prompt hides previously settled agents from the widget; they reappear only when resumed, and `/agents tree` always keeps them available. While subagents are starting or running, press **Left** at the start of the main draft to open it; otherwise Left stays native. Press **Right** at the end of the draft (or in an empty input) to collapse the widget to one line for this session only, without changing saved settings. `/agents tree` remains available regardless of agent activity. See [live navigation](docs/tools-and-ui.md#live-agent-navigation) for controls and compatibility.

**Cost accounting:** Agent rows show estimated USD cost (including cache reads/writes) when reported. Completed, paused, stopped, and failed agents roll up only newly incurred cost. Accounting survives resume, reload, branch navigation, and reaping; nested agents' own costs are counted once. Running-agent costs remain in their rows until settlement. This changes the footer display, not Pi's native session statistics.

- Open **[labs] Footer display** in `/agents settings` to choose a location (**Replace Pi status**, **pi-footer status widget**, or **pi-footer event**), a value (**Only subagent cost** or **Total cost**), and a money icon. Defaults: status widget, settled subagent-only cost, and 💵. The stable ID/key is **`subagent_cost`**.
- **`npm:pi-footer`:** with the default status-key mode, add **Extension Status** through `/footer` and select **`subagent_cost`**. Event mode instead requires a **Pi Event Value** widget with **Widget ID** entered manually and **Raw value only** enabled; event IDs are not listed in the status selector.
- Values publish at session start and immediately on subagent startup, including `💵 $0.0000`, then after settlement/settings changes. Total cost includes the main session plus settled subagents. The icon picker offers three Nerd Font choices when the labs toggle is on, otherwise three emoji choices. Status modes leave your footer untouched; event mode retains a fallback showing the selected value/icon when no extension provides `/footer`. See [Cost display settings](docs/settings.md#labs-cost-display-costdisplay) and the [pi-footer setup guide with exact snippets](docs/pi-footer.md).

Experimental features are marked **[labs]** in settings. Enable **[labs] Nerd Font icons** in `/agents` to show role-specific icons beside agent names (off by default; requires a Nerd Font in your terminal). Loaders appear **before**, never instead of, the role icon. Choose Circle, Braille, or Hourglass under **[labs] Loader style**, with previews of every animation frame and each family's completed, paused, failed, and stopped icons. Custom agent types can set an optional `icon` or use **[labs] Icon** in `/agents types`. See [icon setup](docs/settings.md#labs-nerd-font-icons-nerdfonticons).

Enable **[labs] Enable subagent extensions** in `/agents settings` to reload configured user and trusted-project extension hooks in each subagent’s separate session. It is off by default and experimental: hooks that assume main-session state can cause bugs or unintended consequences. This is configured-file discovery, **not exact main-session inheritance**; CLI-only, inline, and built-in extensions are not reloaded. See [subagent extension settings](docs/settings.md#labs-enable-subagent-extensions-subagentextensions) and read the [limitations](docs/subagent-extension-limitations.md) before enabling.

Enable **[labs] Final Recap** in `/agents` to automatically ask the idle main agent to summarize detached-agent results, keeping the final response in the main thread. It is off by default and suppressed by Subagent Mode Off. **Enabling it may cause extra model turns and uses more tokens and context.** See [Final Recap](docs/settings.md#labs-final-recap-finalrecap).

## Good to know

- Tool policies are **not a sandbox**. Agents share your working directory and OS permissions.
- Children can use your registered extension, MCP and web tools when [Tool Filtering](docs/settings.md#tool-filtering-toolfiltering) permits them. Skills are not automatically loaded; external tools share main-session resources/context.
- Don't run multiple subagent extensions together — they clash on `/agents`.
